**Example application**

**Some thoughts**

- dont mind my prop-types -> I didn't had time to do them property
- same for unit testing (I added some as an example for the countriesSelector.js)
- I would use the ContextApi instead of redux for a project of this size, redux is added as a sample only
- loading indicator should be done with HOC and redux by using custom ids
- node-sass is a bit outdated in my point of view and depends a lot on the build machines etc... -> check out Styled Components :)
- the api provides really bad data for the requirements, I didn't found any bulk fetch..
